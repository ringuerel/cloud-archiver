# Cloud archiver

This project was created not with the intention of breaking the self-hosted goal but to become partial self-hosted as I couln't convince my wife that all our photos and videos were safe in several disks at a personal cloud (which is a cloud in the end) so she wanted to have some "big" cloud company involved...So I decided to keep paying for cloud storage but at a very low rate instead, going from $10 month to $0.3 month (aprox) for the same files.

## Configure cloud provider

Current supported cloud providers and how to configure the needed objects:

- [Google Cloud Platform](./gcp/GCP-README.MD) or GCS Cloud Storage
